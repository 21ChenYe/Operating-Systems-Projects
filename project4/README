Project 4
All test cases passed! Implemented everything!

Tls write: 
- error checked LSA
- used write functionality from slides
- make sure to protect and unprotect pages 
- check ref-count in case of CoW

Tls create:
- error checked LSA
- created new pages and LSA
- protected pages
- set into hash, gotta check if there is collision (in which case, use linked list)

tls read:
- same as write honestly but easier, since no CoW to deal with

tls destroy:
- error check for LSA
- always destroy current threads LSA
- but only sometimes destroy pages
- destroy pages if ref count == 1
- do not destroy if ref count > 1, instead just dec ref count

tls clone:
- error check both current and target LSA
- clone functionality from slides
- create new hash element and TLS
- point to pages of target thread, increment ref count to indicate CoW
