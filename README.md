# Operating-Systems-Projects
BU EC440 Class (Operating Systems) taught by Manual Egele, class no longer in session under same professor


This repo is a collection of five projects completed for the class. 

Project 1 - Simple Shell
Goal was to understand/use Unix/POSIX system calls and develop a simple shell application. Had to support piping, redirection, etc.  
 
Project 2 - Thread Library
Goal was to grok the idea of threads and implement independent, parallel execution within a process. The main deliverable is a basic thread system for Linux. 

Project 3 - Thread Synchronization
This project expands on project 2, and requires the implementation of locking mechanisms and facilitates communication between threads.

Project 4 - Thread Local Storage
This project further expands on project 3 and requires implementation of a library that provides protected memory regions for threads (that they can use as thread local storage). 

Project 5 - File System
Goal is to implement basic file system on top of virtual disk. File structure is up to student, though I personally chose FAT. Must support 16 megabytes of total file(s) size(s) across 8192 datablocks.


Each project directory has README that goes into further depth about the intricacies of the project.
